# Simple customized Game UI for Garry's Mod

This customized Escape Menu for Garry's Mod is designed in a way similar to the default one.

It is translated in English and French.

It features additional menu options with changeable color and a few on-screen details.

Also it's capable of opening URLs directly inside of the Game UI, which makes it really nice to read server's documents.
